# No AI Labs 🚫🤖

Welcome to **No AI Labs** - where we conduct research that has absolutely nothing to do with AI.

All of our projects are manually operated by humans. If you think anything here runs automatically, you're mistaken.
Every single action requires direct human intervention and manual execution.

### Our Mission

At No AI Labs, our mission is to preserve the art of manual labor in a digital age.
We dream of a future where AI does less and humans do more.

### Careers

We’re always hiring humans. Must be capable of clicking buttons. AI need not apply.

## Our Projects

### 🌶️ [Spice](https://github.com/no-ai-labs/spice)
A project that adds flavor to your development experience - completely human-seasoned.

### 📚 [Book Keeper](https://github.com/no-ai-labs/book-keeper)
Traditional record keeping, the old-fashioned way - no algorithms, just good old manual bookkeeping.
